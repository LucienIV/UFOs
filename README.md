# UFOs

## Overview
### Purpose of Analysis
The purpose of this project is to create a webpage that hosts a listing of suspected UFO sightings. A functionality was then created to allow users to filter the listing to return only sightings that fit certain criteria such as date or location.

## Results
### Searching Process
To perform a search one first needs to access the website, either directly through a browser or optimally via a live server. Once on the website the user will see an introductory statement, explanation of the data, and the actual data listing below that. For each sighting in the listing there is a date, city, state, country, shape, duration, and any additional comments. On the left side of the screen the user will see a list of options to filter the search by. The gray text is just default text to provide an example to users of what text should be entered for a given field.

Entering information into any of these boxes and then clicking anywhere else on the webpage will filter the data and only return matching results. For instance a search for sightings on 1/4/2010 in California will initially return three results, but further filtering this by specifying the city of San Pablo will return return one specific result.

## Summary
### Drawback to Design
date search delete

### Recommendation
provide dropdown interactivity
format duration to allow filtering as inconsistency prevents
